--- General ---
- set up external DB to handle things like 'serverprefix' command functionality

- update README to talk about use of Docker and Lavalink, etc.
- eventually update README with invite link for exact permissions that Eggbort
  needs to use all functionality on a server (i.e. not "Admin," but only the specifics)
  
- create a static webpage that contains an invite link and short bot description
  --> e.g. http://septapus.com/
  (including: to be able to add him, you need the following server privileges: ...)
  rahulkiefer.com/eggbort

create a .dockerignore file

--- COGS ------

Help:
  Restructure command categories so there are less categories that are more encompassing:
    1. Music - ...
    2. Server Tools - avatar, joindate, chatclear (alias clear), poll
    3. Bot Properties - ping, serverprefix

Bot Properties:
 - serverprefix: use mongodb Docker image, or MongoDB on a separate instance

Poll:
 - raffle/giveaway

Reminder:
 - see Septapus functionality
 - would need to make use of aforementioned external DB

User Info:
 - e.avatar should return the invoker's own pfp if not argument is provided

Music:
 - bot seems to disconnect itself after not detecting any voice activity for 5
   minutes (this is a problem bc ppl can still be listening to the music while
   not talking/being mute, and the bot would disconnect on them)
   --> maybe change to: leave if bot is alone in call for 5 minutes
 - command to list how much time is left in current song playing (and/or entire queue)
 - study Fredboat interaction (e.g. what happens when he's forcibly disconnected
   and recreate this behavior for Eggbort)

!!! Catch OSError (occurs whenever bot container tries to connect to lavalink container before it's rdy)
and make it throw an exception that causes the bot container to stop completely
(this way, since the docker-compose file tells the bot to restart upon failing with an error,
i won't have to manually restart the bot every time I rebuild the image after making code changes)
